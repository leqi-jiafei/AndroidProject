<!-- 
HTTP 404 [Not Found] - Document or file requested by the client was not found.

Internet Explorer will not display custom pages unless they are larger than 512 bytes, opting instead to display a friendly error page. Google Chrome includes similar functionality, where the 404 is replaced with alternative suggestions generated by Google algorithms, if the page is under 512 bytes in size. Another problem is that if the page does not provide a favicon, and a separate custom 404 page exists, extra traffic and longer loading times will be generated.
